# Cryptography
These are simple ways of implementing and breaking two cryptographies: 
- [Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) 
  - CaesarImplementationOneKey --> is a class I wrote to implement the Caesar Cipher with one key
  - CaesarImplementationTwoKeys --> is a class I wrote to implement the Caesar Cipher with two keys
  - CaesarBreaking --> is a class I wrote to break both Caesar Cipher with one and two keys
  - CaesarCipher --> is a class I received later during the courses from Duke University which implements the Caesar Cipher
  - CaesarCracker --> is a class I received later during the courses from Duke University which implements the breaking of the Caesar Cipher
- [VigenÃ¨re Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher)
  - VigenereCipher --> is a class I received from Duke university which implements the Vigenere Cipher using Caesar Cipher
  - VigenereBreaker --> is a class I wrote to break the Vigenere Cipher

For the Vigenere Cipher, I thought it is a good idea to still use the code from Duke University to see that I am able to work with code someone else wrote.
Additionally, I wrote the documentation for their code.


Project done as part of the online course: 

- [Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming-arrays-lists-data?)

Additionally, there are the WebLogParser, LogAnalyzer and LogEntry classes. In contrast to other classes, I wrote for this course, I did not delete these, because they seemed especially useful to me and I might want to look them up later.
